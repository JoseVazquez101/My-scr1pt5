# My Scripts
Some bash scripts that made to automate various tasks

***

- This repo mainly includes fairly basic enumeration files, focused on pentesting.

# **[JWT Viewer](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/JWT-viewer.sh)**
- Decode the base64 of the header and payload in a JWT

# **[LaTex Injection](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/LaTexInjection.sh)**
- Basic simulation of a LaTex injection in a local environment, the code generates a payload pointing to a target file and generates a pdf with it. Extract the file to plain text

# **[OS identifier](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/OS_identifier.py)**
- Script that identifies the operating system of a computer through the time to live (TTL) of a ping

- Automation testing for basic time-based and blind SQL injections, within a local environment

# **[Basic NoSQLi](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/nosqli.py)**
- Automation testing for basic NoSQL injections based on the use of regular expressions, query manipulation and trial and error loops. This in a local environment

# **[Proc-based PortScan](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/myports_proc.sh)**
- This script shows open ports on a system by reading the /proc/net/tcp connection file

# **[Iteration-based PortScan](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/myports_iteration.sh)**
- This script performs a port scan iteration on the local IP address

# **[Ldap enumerator](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/ldapi.py)**
- This script performs an automated and semi-automated scan of a given URL in order to enumerate the Ldap service in different fields within a local environment

# **[ID-Range finder](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/id_webrange.sh)**
- It uses a basic iteration function between a previously defined range to observe how many id values ​​exist on a page.

# **[Local Hostscan](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/hostscan.sh)**
- A network is scanned for active hosts through iteration based on the ICMP protocol using threads for greater effectiveness

# **[PrivEsc finder](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/PrivEsc_scanner(hav3st3r).sh)**
- Lists possible common vectors for privilege escalation. I use the [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) project as support to compare across a [list](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/binary_list.txt) of potential vulnerable vector binaries. It is still under review

- Another section includes various scripts for various uses

# **[VPN selector](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/vpn_selector.sh)**
- This script automates the execution of an openvpn file for the HackTheBox and TryHackMe platforms

# **[Recursive decompressor](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/recursive_decompressor.sh)**
- Decompress multiple compressed files using 7z

# **[Bash Roulette](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/roulette.sh)**
- Independent project applied in the introduction to Linux course at [Hack4u](https://hack4u.io/), focused on improving scripting skills in Bash

# **[HTBMap](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/My-scr1pt5/blob/main/htbmap.sh)**
